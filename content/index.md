# Nuxt Content

This page corresponds to the `/` route of your website. You can delete it or create another file in the `content/` directory.

Try to navigate to [/about](/about). These 2 pages are rendered by the `pages/[...slug].vue` component.

Navigate to [/static/frameworks](/static/frameworks), which is rendered from a CSV file. 

[/browser](/browser) lets you filter through the $content model.


And this thumbnail is served via /public static content, and styled directly in mardown  
![nuxt content](/img/content.nuxtjs.org.png){.thumbnail},
